Components:
- 1 server (Ubuntu) at 8.8.8.8
- 1 web server: Nginx (listens on :80, serves static files, reverse-proxies to app server)
- 1 application server: runs the application code (generates dynamic responses)
- 1 application files: the deployed codebase on the server
- 1 database: MySQL (stores persistent data)
- 1 domain: foobar.com with www record pointing to 8.8.8.8

Explanations:
- What is a server: a physical/virtual machine running an OS and services to handle requests
- Role of the domain name: human-friendly name that maps to an IP so users can reach the service
- DNS record type of www in www.foobar.com: A record (points directly to 8.8.8.8)
- Role of the web server: terminate HTTP, serve static assets, proxy requests to the app server
- Role of the application server: execute app code and return dynamic content (HTML/JSON)
- Role of the database: persist and query data via SQL
- Server-to-user communication: HTTP over TCP/IP on port 80

Issues (single-server stack):
- SPOF: if the server or any component fails, the entire site is down
- Downtime on deploys/maintenance: restarting web/app can interrupt service
- No scalability: cannot handle high QPS; no load balancing or horizontal scale
